# SAP-Cable-Tachometer-Test
This Code will run on an ESP32 Development Board V1.
The two quadrature encoder signals are wired to GPIO Pins.
Encoder F is wired: ChA to GPIO 14 & ChB to GPIO.
Encoder B is wired: ChA to GPIO 4 & CHB TO GPIO 15.
The counters are displayed on two eight digit 7-Segment displays with MAX7219 drivers.
